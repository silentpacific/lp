LivePulse - Semantic Pulse Engine for Dynamic Blog Content Updates
🎯 Project Overview
LivePulse is an intelligent content analysis and update system that automatically identifies, tracks, and refreshes dynamic facts in blog posts while preserving semantic meaning and context. The system uses AI-powered analysis to detect "Pulse Points" - specific facts that are likely to change over time - and enables controlled, scheduled updates with full context preservation.

🎨 Visual Highlighting System
Color-Coded Layers

🟡 Yellow: Pulse Point (the specific fact)
🔵 Light Blue: Action Phrase (pulse point + associated action)
🩷 Light Pink: Contextual Sentence/Paragraph (broader meaning container)

Superscript Citation System

Each pulse point gets a unique superscript number (¹, ², ³...)
Footnotes displayed at article bottom with source attribution
Click-through functionality to original sources
Version history accessible via footnote interaction

🔄 Update Logic & Validation
Semantic Validation Rules

Context Coherence: New value must make grammatical sense in sentence
Meaning Preservation: Update cannot fundamentally alter article intent
Tone Consistency: Emotional context must remain appropriate
Factual Accuracy: New data must be verifiable and current
Scale Appropriateness: Updated values must be within reasonable ranges

Validation Process
Input: Original Pulse Point + New Value + Full Context
↓
Semantic Analysis: Does new value fit grammatically?
↓
Meaning Check: Does update preserve original intent?
↓
Tone Analysis: Is emotional context still appropriate?
↓
Fact Verification: Is new data accurate and current?
↓
Output: Approved Update OR Rejection + Detailed Reasoning
Rejection Examples

Grammatical Mismatch: "fell to $2.5 million" → "fell to sunny weather" ❌
Meaning Distortion: "stock price rose 10%" → "stock price rose 500%" (context: small gains) ❌
Tone Inconsistency: "disappointing $50 drop" → "disappointing $50 rise" ❌

📅 Update Frequency Options
Frequency Settings

Live: Real-time updates (for critical financial data)
Hourly: Every 60 minutes (volatile stocks, crypto)
Daily: Once per day (general market data, weather)
Weekly: Every 7 days (industry reports, statistics)
Monthly: Every 30 days (demographic data, slow-changing metrics)
Manual: User-triggered only (sensitive content)

Frequency Recommendation Logic
javascriptfunction recommendFrequency(pulseType, volatility, importance) {
  if (pulseType === 'crypto' && volatility === 'high') return 'Hourly';
  if (pulseType === 'stock' && importance === 'critical') return 'Live';
  if (pulseType === 'weather') return 'Daily';
  if (pulseType === 'population') return 'Monthly';
  // ... additional logic
