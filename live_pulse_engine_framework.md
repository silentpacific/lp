# 🫀 LivePulse Engine Framework (v3.0)
> Business rules and product specification for the AI-powered content updater that detects, clusters, and refreshes live facts across blog posts.

---

## 🎯 Product Vision

**LivePulse is a SaaS content intelligence platform** that automatically keeps blog posts and articles current by identifying and updating facts that change over time, while maintaining editorial control and semantic coherence.

### Core Value Proposition
- **For Content Creators**: Never publish outdated information again
- **For Businesses**: Maintain credibility with always-current data
- **For SEO**: Fresh content gets better search rankings
- **For AI/LLM**: Reliable, cited information increases model references

## 🔍 Pulse Point Detection Rules

### What Qualifies as a Pulse Point?
1. **Quantitative Data**: Prices, percentages, statistics, counts
2. **Temporal References**: Dates, "last quarter", "this year", relative time
3. **Dynamic Facts**: Stock prices, weather, population figures, market data
4. **Comparative Statements**: "higher than", "increased by", "compared to"

### What Should NOT Be Pulse Points?
- ❌ Historical events with fixed dates ("World War II ended in 1945")
- ❌ Permanent facts ("Paris is the capital of France")
- ❌ Subjective opinions or editorial content
- ❌ Branded content or marketing copy

### Confidence Scoring Rules
- **High (🔥)**: Well-formatted numbers with clear data types ($67,500, 25°C, 15%)
- **Medium (⚡)**: Recognizable patterns but some ambiguity
- **Low (⚠️)**: Potential pulse points requiring manual review

---

## 🔗 Semantic Clustering Logic

### When to Create Clusters
Pulse points should be clustered when they have:
1. **Mathematical Relationships**: Price → Percentage change → Direction
2. **Temporal Dependencies**: Current value → Historical comparison
3. **Contextual Links**: Subject references, entity relationships
4. **Logical Consistency**: Related facts that must update together

### Cluster Types
- **Mathematical**: Price, percentage, direction (e.g., "Tesla at $248, up 3.2%")
- **Comparative**: Current vs historical values (e.g., "25°C, 5 degrees warmer")
- **Temporal**: Time-based relationships (e.g., "Q3 2024 vs Q3 2023")
- **Descriptive**: Related facts about same entity

---

## ⚡ Update Frequency Guidelines

### Business Rules for Update Timing
- **High Volatility Data** (Crypto, Stocks): 1-4 hours
- **Moderate Change Data** (Weather, News): 3-12 hours  
- **Stable Data** (Demographics, Research): Daily to Monthly
- **Seasonal Data** (Reports, Statistics): Quarterly/Annually

### Priority System
1. **Critical**: Financial data during market hours
2. **High**: Breaking news, weather alerts, crypto during volatility
3. **Medium**: General statistics, population data, research findings
4. **Low**: Historical comparisons, background information

---

## 👀 Editorial Control Requirements

### Manual Approval Workflow
1. **Detection Phase**: AI suggests pulse points with confidence scores
2. **Review Phase**: Editor approves/rejects suggestions and sets sources
3. **Update Phase**: System fetches new data and shows preview
4. **Publishing Phase**: Editor approves changes before going live

### Editor Override Capabilities
- Manually edit any pulse point value
- Change data sources and update frequencies
- Pause/resume individual pulses or entire clusters
- Rollback to previous versions
- Add custom validation rules

---

## 🛡️ Quality Assurance Rules

### Pre-Publication Validation
1. **Grammar Check**: Ensure updated content reads naturally
2. **Semantic Coherence**: Verify meaning is preserved
3. **Fact Consistency**: Check mathematical relationships are correct
4. **Source Validation**: Confirm data source is reliable and current

### Conflict Resolution
- **Logic Breaks**: If update creates grammatical errors → Auto-rewrite with AI
- **Inconsistencies**: If cluster relationships break → Flag for manual review
- **Source Failures**: If data unavailable → Use last known value + timestamp
- **Validation Errors**: If content doesn't pass checks → Hold for editor approval

---

## 🔌 Integration Requirements

### CMS Platform Support
- **WordPress**: Plugin + REST API integration
- **Ghost**: Admin API integration
- **Shopify**: Custom app for product descriptions
- **Custom CMS**: JSON/API endpoints + webhook support

### Data Source Standards
- **Primary Sources**: Official APIs (CoinGecko, OpenWeather, Yahoo Finance)
- **Government Data**: Bureau of Statistics, Fed APIs, Official databases
- **Fallback Sources**: AI research with citations and confidence scoring
- **Custom Sources**: User-provided APIs with validation

### Authentication & Security
- **API Key Management**: Secure storage and rotation
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API limits and implement backoff
- **Data Privacy**: No storage of sensitive user content
- **Audit Trail**: Log all changes and data sources
